## PDI aditions

**NOTE :** The bundled providers are modified to use facter 1.7.x, with improved detection of SmartOS

Besides some actual patching to pkgin module itself, there is a payload directory with some other modules. This was because the solaris module dissapeared from puppetforge and to the fact that we have decided to create a single package with all the SmartOS related modules and this is the easiest way to to it.
To actually build the package, you must clone on a directory named pkgin, and from the same level where this directory lives run

    pkg_create \
        -c pkgin/pkgbuild/summary -d pkgin/pkgbuild/description \
        -B pkgin/pkgbuild/buildinfo -f pkgin/pkgbuild/packinlist \
        -I /etc/puppet/modules is-puppet.tgz


Puppet pkgin Module
===================

This is a Puppet module to install and uninstall packages using [`pkgin`][0], a
binary package manager for `pkgsrc` as used by [Joyent SmartMachines][1] by
enabling a provider for the standard [`package` resource type][2].

Installation
------------

The latest stable release can be downloaded from the Puppet Module Forge: [mudge/pkgin][3]

Using the `puppet-module` gem, this is as simple as:

```console
$ cd /opt/local/etc/puppet/modules
# puppet-module install mudge/pkgin
Installed "mudge-pkgin-0.0.1" into directory: pkgin
```

(Assuming `/opt/local/etc/puppet/modules` is in your `modulepath`.)

Usage
-----

```puppet
package { 'vim':
  ensure   => present,
  provider => pkgin,
}

package { 'emacs':
  ensure   => absent,
  provider => pkgin,
}
```

If using the Service Management Facility (SMF) to run `puppet agent` (or `puppetd`),
ensure that the `pkgin` binary is in your `PATH` with something like the following:

```xml
<exec_method name='start' type='method'
    exec='/opt/local/bin/puppet agent --config %{config_file}' timeout_seconds='60'>
  <method_context>
    <method_environment>
      <envvar name='PATH' value='/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin'/>
    </method_environment>
  </method_context>
</exec_method>
<property_group name='application' type='application'>
  <propval name='config_file' type='astring' value='/opt/local/etc/puppet/puppet.conf'/>
</property_group>
```

Features
--------

At the moment, this provider only has two of the standard Puppet package provider
features:

* *installable*: The provider can install packages.
* *uninstallable*: The provider can uninstall packages.
